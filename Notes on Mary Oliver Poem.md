I'm writing this note after reflecting on an exercise I did in my journal.

While reading a collection of poetry at the library, I came across a Mary Oliver Poem:
>Instructions for living a life.  
>Pay attention.
>Be astonished.
>Tell about it.

I was struck by how such a short poem conveyed so much in 'felt meaning'. Each of those terms felt as though they had immense definitions in the current moment of my life. That they would have continued, evolving meaning in future moments. I decided to take a note in my journal and write my 'felt meaning' of these concepts.

### Pay Attention
>Active listening. Avoid distractions and look to deeply absorb the material. Do not distract yourself with internal thoughts that draw you away from the sensations you are interacting with.

### Be Astonished
> Recognize the beauty and 'impactfulness' of what is being said to you, or the phenomenon that you are observing. This step doesn't require full 'rationalization' of what is happening, but it can if that feeling comes to you. Remember that the sensation of awe and astonishment is coming from somewhere important, perhaps beyond what you can rationalize through language.

### Tell about it
>Recall. Here is where we move from the felt to the applied. Though it can feel immensely moving to be astonished by the workings of the world, we rob ourselves and others of truly impactful work when we don't move these felt sensations into imperfect work and expression.

This is an exercise that I would like to do with even more 'standard' texts (ones that I can revisit and find new meaning in).
