What do I (Dan O'Sullivan) want out of a graduate program?
I want to be surrounded by bright people, who are looking to make a difference in the world.
I want to learn from world-class teachers and apply those learnings with enthusiastic peers.
I want exposure to problems in the world that I currently don't even know exist,
Or don't appreciate their extent and their impact on people's lives.

I want to be surrounded by people who are taken aback at the achievements of humans
But only for a moment.
Instead of being pushed out of the arena
The moment only serves to widen their perspective;
And then, they dive right back into the depth.

I want to be surrounded by people who realize there are two sides to every coin
But recognize that both the balance and composition of these coins are ever-changing.
Stone, Glass, Bronze. Steel, Silicon, Gold.
I want to marvel alongside people as this dragon's clutch is knocked skyward
Tumbling, off-kilter, through the air.

I want to engage  with people who engage with the world
Both natural and man-made
And are simultaneously struck by the immense beauty and the immense injustice.
The immense opportunity that exists
And the soul-wrenching inequality of access to that opportunity.

Though I've strived to be BLANK, useful, and kind to as many of the people I encounter as I can be;
I know that I have failed more times than I've succeeded.

Though I've strived to give all that I am capable of to the people who could use it the most;
I know that I have failed more times than I've succeeded.

Though I've strived to internalize that which others know far more intimately than I,
That nothing, hell even the thing itself, in life is to be taken for granted;
I still cry when I'm reminded - "I forgot"

(Placeholder, conclusion - restatement)
I want to be surrounded by bright people, who are looking to make a difference in the world.
