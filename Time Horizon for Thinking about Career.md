This is a good series of questions, which leads me to evaluate where my own decision making is coming from.

When do we 'over-rationalize' decision making, in the face of much that is uncontrollable? I'd like to borrow a phrase from the question, look at it's use in a related field (data processing and modeling) and then create some assertions.

'Divide the signal from the noise'

I'd like to break out those 2 concepts and 2 related phenomena:
- Signal
- Noise
- Bias
- Variance

First a table to outline the concepts at a high level:

| Component     | Definition                                     | Source                                          | Effects                                           | Examples                                           |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Signal        | Meaningful info or pattern in data.           | Underlying phenomena of interest.             | Identifies actionable insights in data.            | E.g., Face in a photograph.                        |
| Noise         | Random, unpredictable fluctuations in data.  | Measurement errors, randomness.                 | Obscures true patterns in data.                   | Sensor data with electronic interference.          |
| Bias          | Systematic error, consistent deviation.       | Data collection or model assumptions.           | Introduces consistent inaccuracies.               | Measurement instrument with a calibration offset.  |
| Variance      | Fluctuation in model predictions.             | Model complexity and data sensitivity.          | Affects model generalization.                     | Overfitting due to complex models.                 |

I think that for decision making in life we should be focused on tuning into the signal, reducing the noise, identifying the bias, and accepting the variance.

We should focus on being able to separate 'noise':
 - That which randomly alters our perception of the world 
 - That which randomly alters our perception of what we want out of our life
 - That which randomly alters our perception of our intrinsic value as human beings

From what we can reasonably:
- Know is happening in our world 
- Know we want out of our life
- Know our intrinsic value as a human being is.

	Question: Where does noise in your life come from?

Simultaneously we must internalize that noise is not the same as variance. **Variance is fluctuation in outcome**. Even under a hypothetical scenario in which we are able to completely sort out signal from the noise, variance would still exist.

This is because we cannot, as one person, capture all of the signals that exist in our life. It would be complete information overload. 

Consider for a moment just the visual signals that we are exposed to. If you were forced to capture the entirety of what you are 'seeing' at each given moment, your brain would melt, or at least misfire in some unimaginable way. 

There are are a near infinite number of unique wavelengths of light that exist before you, a subsection of which pass through the lens of your eye, a subsection of which strike your retina, a subsection of which get processed enough to be transmitted as signal through your ocular nerve, a subsection of which fire off a neural process in your brain, etc, etc, etc.

Therefore the final resolution of the world that we hold in our minds is already a very low resolution picture indeed.

We make decisions off of a combination of these incomplete signals all the time, because it's really our only option. Only through external technology and external social networks (don't read as facebook - read as friends, family, mentors) can we make choices on more complete data.

**Accepting variance of outcome**, therefore, becomes a necessity of decision making in life. Not only are there many things we can *'reasonably know'* that we cannot *control*, there are also **infinite** things we cannot even reasonably know.
